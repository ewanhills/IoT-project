# IoT-project description

The concept that I have decided to base my project on is Homeowner security.

I wanted to use a rarpberry pi along with a vibration sensor to alert the homeowner when or if their property is 
being tampered with. The device will be mounted into or onto a door, or primarly a gate. When a door or gate is 
being tampered with an alert will be sent to the homeowner warning them that someone may be around their property.

I also plan to efficantly program the raspberry pi so that it remains acitve at times when the homeowners are away,
as well as remainig inactive during periods of which homeowners are home. This will help reduce the amount of 
unnessary alerts that will be sent to the owner.

A button will be placed on the raspberyy pi that will be arm it at all times. This will be usefull when the homeowners
are away for extended periods of time ie when the may be away at a business metting or a holiday. Some aspects have yet been 
undecided such as external power supply, external factors and durability. I would like to prove that the concept works on a rasbperry pi
then afterwards use a more power efficant device such as arduino which could work for far longer periods of time.
